Documentation on profiles of trace gases derived from aircraft data.

Jennifer Logan and Inna Megretskaia, March, 1999.

Updated in Sept. 2000 with PEM-Tropics B data.
Updated in February, 2003, with TRACE-P data.

This supercedes the files that were contained in 
/users/ctm/yhw/gmg/aircraft/profiles

This directory contains results of an analysis of aircraft data, and
provides vertical profiles over selected geographic regions, as described in
more detail below.

Every subdirectory of this directory contains mean profiles for given
specie for up to 39 regions and a postscript file with boxplots of
these mean profiles for different altitudes.  

=======
regions
======
This ASCII file contains 
the latitude/longitude boundaries of the regions over which the aircraft
data were averaged, the month in which the data were taken, and the region
number.

=============
region.map.ps
============
The postscipt file "region.map.ps"  shows the regions on a world map.

==============================
NO, ACET, PAN, C2H6, H2O2,HNO3
==============================
Each subdirectory contains data files called Name.specie.new.pem,
Name.specie.new.gte, Name.specie.new.aase, Name.specie.new.success, 
Name.specie.new.sonex, Name.sum.specie.new.strat and 
Name.win.specie.new.strat, where the last part of the name corresponds to 
different missions (see below).  Name is the same as name listed in file 
regions and specie= NO, ACET, PAN, C2H6, H2O2,HNO3.

=================
Name.specie.new.*
================
Every line of the data file has 11 numbers which correspond to:

1.  PRESSURE
2.  NUMBER OF POINTS
3.  MONTHLY MEAN VALUE
4.  MONTHLY MEDIAN VALUE
5.  STANDARD DEVIATION
6.  10TH PERCENTILE
7.  25TH PERCENTILE
8.  75TH PERCENTILE
9.  90TH PERCENTILE
10. MIN. VALUE
11. MAX. VALUE

Vertical Scale:
The pressures are provided for convenience, but NOTE that the data were
provided keyed to altitude, and the data were binned in altitudes, for
0-1, 1-2, ... 11-12 km.  Thus the pressures correspond to altitudes
0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, 9.5, 10.5, 11.5 km, which
are midpoints of 1 km boxes.  These altitudes were converted to pressure
with the formula

  pressure = 1013*(1.-2.257e-5*(altitude*1.e3))^5.2533

by Yuhang Wang.  This formula gives an excellent approximation to the US
Standard Atmosphere for 45 N, Spring/Fall.  

The GTE date are all given in pressure altitude, which uses the US
standard atmosphere.  Thus this formula is the appropriate way to
convert pressure to altitude for all latitudes (which would not be the
case had geometric altitude been used).


=========================
Name.specie.new.*.wo.filt
=========================

These file have the same structure as Name.specie.new.*. No selection
for stratospheric air was made to select points used in analysis to obtain
these files, so in general they are based on more data points than the
"filtered" ones. We considered air at above 6 km to be stratospheric if it 
has ozone values > 100 ppbv.

================
Name.profile.ps
===============
This postscript file provides a plot of the profile for the various regions,
and gives a box plot with the 10 and 90th percentiles (extreme), 25th and
75th  percentiles (box), median (vertical line) and mean (x).  The number of
points at each level is also given.


ORIGIN OF THE DATA USED IN THESE PROFILES.

The aircraft profiles are an update of those shown in Wang et al.  (JGR,
103, 10,727-10,756, 1998).  The data used in that paper by Jennifer
Logan and Yuhang Wang were provided by Scott Smyth, who was working
with John Bradshaw and Scott Sandholm at Georgia Tech. They provided (in 
spring 1996) files containing GTE and AASE data, species by species, made 
from the Georgia Tech merges.  The files were provided as "dumped" Splus 
objects, and may be found in /data/gatech/....   JAL has the documentation
on the Splus files.  The files contained the concentrations, latitude,
longitude, altitude, and a filter for whether the data was in the
stratosphere.  The NO data had been filtered for solar zenith angle
less than 70 degrees. The data had also been filtered for stratospheric
air, using the conditions O3>120 and CO<80 and N2O<308.

The files from Georgia Tech contained data from the following
missions:  ABLE2A, ABLE3A, ABLE3B, CITE1A, CITE1B, CITE2, CITE3,
PEM-WA, and TRACE in one set of files labeled "gte" (all missions in
northern summer and autumn), and ABLE2B, PEM-WB and AASE in another
labelled "aase" (all in Feb. or May (ABLE 2B).

In Dec.98/Jan99  we added an analysis of data from PEM-Tropics A, using
the Harvard merges, and updated the files for the other regions to
include more statistics (n, mean, max, std. dev., percentiles (10, 25,
75, 90th), and max and min).  The user can now see how many data points
were averaged together in each region.  The regions used by YHW were
slightly modified in a few cases to increase n, and the box over S.
Africa was divided in two, to give a northern region that was an
area with active fires, and a southern region where there were no
active fires.  For PEM-Tropics A there are now 6 new regions, all using
the DC-8 data.  We did not use the P3B data which goes up to 6-7 km.
Inna has the analysis programs for PEM-Tropics, and for making the new
files for the earlier missions.

In Jan99/Feb99 analysis of data from 3 more missions was done - SONEX,
SUCCESS and STRAT missions. There is not much data at lower altitudes for
these missions, on the other hand there are many points at higher
altitudes, which is not typical for other missions. Merges created by
Lyatt Jaegle with Harvard program were used. Splus objects with selected
variables were created from the ASCII files and these objects were later
used to create monthly profiles. Six regions were selected altogether,
2 for each mission. Data for STRAT missions were diveded into 2 categories 
- "summer" (96/07/22 - 96/08/07, 96/09/13) and "winter" (95/10/20 - 95/11/09,
96/01/26 - 96/02/15 and 96/12/02-96/12/13).

PEM-Tropics B profiles were added at a later date, using the same regions as
for PEM-Tropics A if appropriate.

In February of 2003 vertical profles were made for TRACE-P mission. For
information about this compaign, go to the end of this README.

================
NO subdirectory:
================
For PEM-Tropics A, STRAT, SUCCESS and SONEX profiles 1-min merges were 
used (ASCII files /users/trop/mgs/terra/chem1d/INPUT/dc8_1min.data,
 ~lyj/data/strat/1m*da1 (~iam/amalthea/nox/1m.dat1.all),  
~lyj/data/success/1M*DA1 (~iam/amalthea/nox/1M.DA1.ALL) and
~iam/amalthea/nox/sonex.1m.all correspondingly).
For success mission to filter out the spikes due to fresh aircraft exchaust
the following filter was used:
   If NO was greater than 300 pptv and if CO2 was higher than a background
   level (of 295.0+0.2333*N2O), then these points correspond to fresh
   aircraft exhaust where both NO and CO2 where enhanced.
In addition, three flights of the DC-8 were almost entirely dedicated to flying
behind a 747 aircraft. These flights (96/05/03, 96/05/04, 96/05/07) were
eliminated from analysis of NO.
   For Pem Tropics B 10 sec merges were used (for both dc8 and p3b), Splus
objects are ~iam/.SGIData/data10sec.b and ~iam/.SGIData/data10sec.b.p.

==================
HNO3 subdirectory:
==================
For PEM-Tropics A acid merges were used (Splus object 
/data/pem-t/dc8/.SGIData/dataaacid) and for SONEX HNO3 merges were used
(ASCII file ~iam/amalthea/nox/H3.sonex.all).
   For Pem-Tropics B HNO3 (*nhatg*) merges were used, Splus objects are
~iam/.SGIData/datahno3.b and ~iam/.SGIData/datahno3.b.p.

/data/pem-t/dc8/.SGIData/datapan and ASCII file 
~iam/amalthea/nox/PAN.sonex.all correspondingly).
   For Pem-Tropics B PAN merges were used (mrg_shgc1*), it was done
for dc8 only. Splus object is ~iam/.SGIData/datapan.b.   

==================
H2O2 subdirectory:
==================
For PEM-Tropics A and for SONEX H2O2 merges were used (Splus object 
/data/pem-t/dc8/.SGIData/datah2o2 and ASCII file 
~iam/amalthea/nox/H2O2.sonex.all correspondingly).
   For PEM-Tropics H2O2 merges were used (made by iam). ASCII files are
/users/trop/iam/amalthea/merges/mrg_hbper*, Splus objects - 
~iam/amalthea/.SGIData/datah2o2.b and  ~iam/amalthea/.SGIData/datah2o2.b.p.

==================
C2H6 subdirectory:
==================
Hydrocarbon merges were used for PEM-Tropics A, SONEX and STRAT
(Splus object /data/pem-t/dc8/.SGIData/datahc and ASCII files
~iam/amalthea/nox/HC.sonex.all and ~iam/amalthea/nox/hc.strat.all
correspondingly).
  Hydrocarbon merges were also used for PEM-Tropics B. Splus objects
are datahc.b and datahc.b.p.  

==================
ACET subdirectory:
==================
Acetone profiles for SONEX mission were obtained from acetone merge
(ASCII file ~iam/amalthea/nox/KT.sonex.all
   Acetone merges (ASCII files ~/amalthea/merges/mrg_shgc3* were
used for Pem-Tropics B, for dc8 aircraft only. Splus object is
dataacet.b.
 
===============================
CO, O3, ALK4, C3H8, ETHE, PRPE
===============================

Each of these subdirectories is similar to ones described above. The only
difference is that we did not have Splus objects provided by Georgia Tech
for these species, so all the objects were made by Inna Megretskaia.

======
CO, O3 
======
For PEM-Tropics A mission 10-sec merges were used (Splus object 
/data/pem-t/dc8/.SGIData/data10sec)
Same for PEM-Tropics B 10-sec merges were used (Splus objects 
iam/.SGIData/data10sec.b and iam/.SGIData/data10sec.b.p)
For Trace-A mission 10-sec merges were used (object
~iam/amalthea/.SGIData/datatraceA)
For ABLE2A non-standard merges from /data/gatech/GTE_NEW/able_2a were used 
(object ~iam/.SGIData/dataa2a) 
For ABLE2B non-standard merges from /data/gatech/GTE_NEW/able_2b were used 
(object ~iam/.SGIData/dataa2b) 
For STRAT 1-min merges were used (ASCII files in ~lyj/data/strat, Splus
objects - ~iam/.SGIData/amalthea/datastrat.sum and
~iam/.SGIData/amalthea/datastrat.win)
For SONEX 1-min merges were used (ASCII files in ~lyj/data/sonex, Splus
object ~iam/.SGIData/amalthea/datasonex)
For SUCCESS 1-min merges were used (ASCII files in ~lyj/data/success, Splus
object ~iam/.SGIData/amalthea/datasuccess)
FOR PEM-WA 90-sec merges from /data/gatech/GTE_NEW/pwa were used (Splus
object is ~iam/amalthea/.SGIData/datapwa)
FOR PEM-WB 10-sec merges from /data/gatech/GTE_NEW/pwb were used (Splus
object is ~iam/amalthea/.SGIData/datapwb10s)

=======================
ALK4, C3H8, ETHE, PRPE
=======================

To create vertical profiles in these subdirectories, data from 4 missions
- PEM-Tropics A, B, STRAT and SONEX were used. (PRPE measurements were not
available for STRAT mission).

For PEM-Tropics A, B missions, hydrocarbon merges were used (Splus objects 
/data/pem-t/dc8/.SGIData/datahc, ~iam/.SGIData/datahc.b and 
~iam/amalthea/.SGIData/datahc.b.p)
For STRAT hydrocarbon merges were used (ASCII files in ~lyj/data/strat, Splus
objects - ~iam/.SGIData/datastrathc.sum and ~iam/.SGIData/datastrathc.win)
For SONEX hydrocarbon merges were used (ASCII files used to be in 
~lyj/data/sonex, Splus object is ~iam/.SGIData/amalthea/datasonex.hc)

====
CH4
====

For Trace-P 10 sec merges were used (in
/data/tracep/merge_final_v3/MERGES/DC8_LARC/10sec and
/data/tracep/merge_final_v3/MERGES/P3B_LARC/10sec. Splus objects are
~iam/.SGIData/data10s.tracep and ~iam/.SGIData/data10s.tracep.p3b.
For ABLE-3A and ABLE-3B 10-second merges were used (Splus objects
dataable3a.10s and dataable3b.10s).
For Pem-Tropics A and B 10 sec merges were used (objects data10sec and 
data10sec.b)
For CITE-2 60-sec merge was used.

======
CH3OH
======

Data for 4 missions were used - SONEX, PEM WEST B, PEM TROPICS B and 
TRACE-P. 
   For SONEX acetone merge was used (original merges are in 
/data/sonex/merges, Splus object ~iam/.SGIData/data.sonex.acet)
   For PEM WEST B I had to use 30 second merge (merges are in
/as/data/master/dsk/data1/gatech/GTE/pem.west.b/30_sec, Splus object
is ~iam/.SGIData/data.pwb.30s), so many numbers in this file are
repeated up to 5 times and number of points for every bin is in
some sense misleading. I tried to use PAN merge first, but it has only
2 non-missing values for CH3OH.
   For PEM TROPICS B I used the acetone merge (from /data/pem-tb/dc8/merges,
Splus object is ~iam/.SGIData/dataacet.b). There is no acetone data
for P3B, so I used only DC8 flights.
   For TRACE-P I used oxygenate merges from 
/data/tracep/merge_final_v3/MERGES/DC8_LARC/SHGC3, my Splus object is
~iam/.SGIData/dataoxy.tracep. This merge was done for DC8 aircraft only.

====
CO2
====

Data for 4 missions were used -  PEM WEST B and TRACE-P.

   For PEM WEST B 30 second merge was used, because 10 sec merge does not
have CO2 (merges are in /as/data/master/dsk/data1/gatech/GTE/pem.west.b/30_sec,
 Splus object is ~iam/.SGIData/data.pwb.30s.
   For TRACE-P I used 10 sec merge (for both dc8 and p3b flights),
merges are in /data/tracep/merge_final_v3/MERGES/DC8_LARC/10sec and
/data/tracep/merge_final_v3/MERGES/P3B_LARC/10sec. Splus objects are
~/.SGIData/data10s.tracep and ~/.SGIData/data10s.tracep.p3b.

***************************************************************************

   February 12, 2003.
   TRACE-P data.

All the merges used for TRACE-P vertical profiles can be found in 
/data/tracep/merge_final_v3/MERGES/DC8_LARC and 
/data/tracep/merge_final_v3/MERGES/P3B_LARC. Most species were
measured for both aircrafts, some were measured only on DC8 flights.
   For CO, NO and CH4 I used 10s merges, made specially for us (with
smaller number of species, than all other merges. Splus objects are
~iam/.SGIData/data10s.tracep and ~iam/.SGIData/data10s.tracep.p3b
correspondingly.
   For NO and H2O2 1 minute merges were used. H2O2 was measured only
on DC8 flights. Splus objects are ~iam/.SGIData/data1min.tracep and 
~iam/.SGIData/data1min.tracep.p3b.
   For CH3OH and ACET oxygenate merge was used 
(/data/tracep/merge_final_v3/MERGES/DC8_LARC/SHGC3/final-v3-mrgshgc3d_all.trp)
Splus object is  ~iam/.SGIData/dataoxy.tracep.
   Hydrocarbon merges were used for ALK4, C2H6, C3H8, ETHE, PRPE and 
C2H2. Corresponding Splus objects are ~iam/.SGIData/datahc.tracep and
~iam/.SGIData/datahc.tracep.p3b.
   5 minute merge was used for PAN (Splus objects are 
~iam/.SGIData/data5min.tracep and ~iam/.SGIData/data5min.tracep).  This was on
Singh's recommendation, as there was no PAN-based merge.
   /data/tracep/merge_final_v3/MERGES/DC8_LARC/NHMIC/final-v3-mrgnhmicd_all.trp
was used for HNO3, it was measured only on DC8. (Splus object is
~iam/.SGIData/data.acid.tracep). (Talbot's recommendation).
   Regions for TRACE-P were added to ASCII file regions.
